# How to Use PON CAD.rar to Design Scaffolding in 3D
 
PON CAD.rar is a file that contains the installation package of PON CAD, a 3D scaffolding design software developed by MEC CAD. PON CAD is a powerful tool that helps designers, renters and manufacturers project small and big structures with scaffolding systems of any type, brand and model. In this article, we will show you how to use PON CAD.rar to design scaffolding in 3D.

[**Download Zip**](https://corppresinro.blogspot.com/?d=2tLV3Y)

 
## Step 1: Download and Install PON CAD.rar
 
To download PON CAD.rar, you need to visit the official website of MEC CAD[^1^] and fill out a form with your personal and professional information. You will then receive an email with a link to download the file. Alternatively, you can also request a free trial version of PON CAD by contacting MEC CAD directly.
 
Once you have downloaded PON CAD.rar, you need to extract it using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will find an executable file called Setup.exe that will guide you through the installation process. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose the destination folder and select the scaffolding libraries that you want to use. You can also customize your preferences and settings later.
 
## Step 2: Open Your Plan and Develop 2D Modules
 
After installing PON CAD, you can launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see a user interface that runs on standard 3D CAD and allows you to design in total freedom. You can start by opening your plan, which can be a 2D or 3D drawing or even a pre-processed image. You can import your plan from various formats, such as DWG, DXF, PDF, JPG or PNG.
 
Once you have opened your plan, you can use PON CAD commands to trace the perimeter of the structure that you want to scaffold. PON CAD will automatically create volumetric modules that represent the scaffold. You can modify these modules by changing their dimensions, orientation, elevation and specific characteristics. You can also add or delete modules as needed.
 
## Step 3: Develop the Scaffolding in 3D
 
The next step is to develop the scaffolding in every detail. You can do this by using a simple command that transforms the modules into scaffolds with all the components, such as standards, ledgers, braces, boards, couplers and accessories. You can modify and integrate each component by using both CAD and PON CAD commands. You can also use advanced features like automatic alignment, rotation, mirroring and copying.
 
PON CAD allows you to design any type of scaffolding system, such as ringlock, cuplock, tube and fitting, kwikstage, European frame, American frame or roofing. You can choose from over 40 available libraries of scaffolding brands and types[^1^], or integrate PON CAD with libraries from your manufacturer. You can also create your own libraries using open formats.
 
## Step 4: Generate Bill of Materials and Other Outputs
 
The final step is to generate the bill of materials (BOM) and other outputs that will help you with your project management. PON CAD automatically calculates the BOM for each scaffold or for the whole project. You can specify work phases to facilitate the creation of quotes, the planning of your warehouse and the transport procedure. You can also export the BOM in various formats, such as Excel or PDF.
 
Besides the BOM, PON CAD also provides other outputs that will improve your work quality and efficiency. For example, you can generate technical drawings, assembly schemes and sections to increase safety on site. You can also perform structural analysis of scaffolding according to local regulations[^1^]. Moreover, you can create video presentations, rendering and 3D VR to impress your clients.
